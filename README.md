# Convex-Polygon-Calculator
My attempt at a program that can receive the Cartesian coordinates of all vertices of a convex polyhedron, then solve for its volume and surface area.

Features:
- The ability to distinguish between convex vertices and concave vertices (those not belonging to the convex hull) in relation to the set of input vertices
- Calculate number of actual edges, faces, vertices of the convex hull created from all input vertices
- Calculate volume and surface area of the convex hull

Requirements:
- Known all Cartesian coordinates of all vertices
